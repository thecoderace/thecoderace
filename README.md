### Hello 👋🏽

My name is Kara (Jk) 𓆦 I'm a book and winter-loving humanist.
* I'm actively developing a `growth mindset`, and firmly encourage prioritizing `#mentalhealth`. 
* My hobbies consist of:
    * reading 📚 • sleeping 💤 • stretching 🧘🏽‍♀️ • rollerskating 🛼 • anime & mang/hwa 🍥 • Pinterest-surfing 📌
      • watching cafe vlogs 🧋 and mukbangs 🍲 on YouTube • learning to `code` to improve my programming capabilities 👩🏽‍💻
* I aspire to be a self-taught programmer specializing in Front-End Development, with hopes to further advance as a Full-Stack Developer!
