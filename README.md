### Hello 👋🏽

My name is Kara (Jk) 𓆦

* I'm a book and winter-loving humanist.
* My hobbies include reading, sleeping, rollerskating, and pretty much investing most of my free-time in learning to code to advance my programming capability!
* I aspire to be a self-taught programmer specialising in Front-End Development, with the hopes of further advancing my career as a Full-Stack Developer!
